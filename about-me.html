    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <section>
        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I currently work as an auto claims adjuster and have done that for a few years.
            I have been looking into becoming a Software Engineer for longer than that, and have finally decided to make the leap.
        I am driven by a love for problem-solving. I have been married for five years and we have a one year-old boy who keeps us on our toes!</p>
