# Personal-Portfolio

This repository has the HTML code for my personal portfolio as well as a profile picture of me and 2 image snippets of projects that I have created. Make sure the images are in the same folder as the HTML files so that they will load correctly.

The main page has a brief biography and my picture.
The About Me page briefly highlights my background, education, career goals, and personal interests.
The projects page showcases three of the projects I've made for a coding bootcamp.
The Skills page lists out my technical skills and programming languages, frameworks, libraries, and softwares I have experience in.
On the Contact Me page, there is a form that can be filled out so send me a message.
At the bottom of each page is a button that links to my Git Hub and my LinkedIn accounts.
